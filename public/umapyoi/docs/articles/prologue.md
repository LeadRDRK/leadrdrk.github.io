## Prologue
According to the legend, a group of people with "horse ears and divine powers" had lived here before we set foot on the land. These people claimed to have been guided here by the "Three Goddesses". The villagers called them "Umamusume" because all of them were female and had the speed of a good horse. 

They galloped over the boundless grassland and disappeared into the distance, leaving only a trace behind......

Because of this presence, some villagers began to believe in the Three Goddesses, hoping that they would be given equal power by the Goddesses. These villagers not only built statues of the Three Goddesses and offered carrots, a favorite of the Umamusume, to the statues, but also carved jewels in the shape of the carrots and offered them to the goddesses.

Once when offering a jewel to the statue of the goddess, the jewel suddenly and violently changed into a crystal like a flame. The priest held up the crystal in front of the crowd, and in an instant it became "Umamusume". The congregation exclaimed. 

Today, with the will of "Umamusume", we continue to run in this unknown land......
