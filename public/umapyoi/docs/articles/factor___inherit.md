# Factor & Inherit
"What is Factor? What is Inheritance?" and other related questions are mainly documented here.

## Factor Inheritance
According to legend: Umamusume had heard the guidance of the Three Goddesses under the Three Goddesses Statue, and saw a pair of figures running into the distance shining brightly. 

 In actuality, the Three Goddesses Statue, while blessing Umamusume Soul, is also making Wish an inheritance. Therefore, the Three Goddesses Statue is the place of "Factor Inheritance".

To perform a Factor Inheritance, you first need to prepare two different Umamusume Wishes. 

 Having only one Wish or creating a conflict will result in the Factor Inheritance not being able to be performed. 

 Not being able to perform a Factor Inheritance will directly result in the process not being able to be performed.

Factor Inheritance is probabilistic. The higher the level, the more likely a Factor is to be effectively inherited, and the greater the number of Factors that can be effectively inherited, the greater the likelihood that they will be effectively inherited. 

 Factor Inheritance can break through the upper limit of the original Umamusume Soul's ability, bringing it to a whole new level. This is something that is difficult to achieve with the training process. That's why experienced trainers value both training and inheritance.

## Retire Register Lectern
Retire Register Lectern is a lectionary that is used at the end of the training, where the trainer completes the evaluation by recording all the information about the soul, and then collects the soul's "wish".

After Fully Fledged, Overall rankings will be determined. As a general rule, the higher the ranking the better the ability and the stronger the will to be able to stay. So please raise your ranking as high as possible.

For some unknown reason, the results of enchantments may change after registration. 

 Based on the survey, it appears that each registration changes the predicted outcome of enchanting the same item. However, this effect only affects the person who made the registration and no one else. 

 Conversely, enchantment also affects the outcome of the next acquired factor.

It is well known that there is a limit to the growth of souls, and the same is true for human growth. 

 It takes more than individual effort to make a breakthrough in human growth; it takes encouragement, guidance, and direction from all; and the same is true for the soul - it takes a different kind of wish to guide those who come after them to keep moving forward and make new breakthroughs.

## Umamusume Wish
Umamusume Wish is a byproduct of Fully Fledged, these blue crystals hold the original Soul's hopes for the future. 

 Umamusume Wish has a number of "factors" in addition to its original name. The "factors" are the abilities that can be inherited and the spirit that will be passed on.

Each Umamusume Wish is bound to have a Status factor, an Extra Attribute factor, and an Inherent Skill factor, which are recorded using blue font, pink font, and green font to indicate them, respectively. 

 Other factors, which may be related to skill, Ranking, and other aspects to be verified, are shown in gray.

There is a probability that the Extra Attribute Factor and the Gray Factor will not be fully inherited in Factor Inheritance. 

 There is a chance that some of the factors will not be inherited at all, so there is a certain luck in Factor Inheritance itself. 

 Practically speaking, it is not uncommon for Umamusume Soul to inherit all factors in full.

Overall, the higher the Ranking, the stronger the Wish left by Umamusume. The strength of the Wish is expressed in the number of Factors and the Rating of the Factors. The stronger the Wish the more factors with higher Ranking.
