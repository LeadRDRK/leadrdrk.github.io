# Umamusume Soul
"What is Umamusume Soul?" and other related questions are mainly documented here.

## Umamusume Soul
So-called "Uma Musume", is a group of girls who were born to run.

They have inherited names from another world - some of their original owners have been ill-fated, some have shone for generations ......

They inherit their souls and continue to run ......

The way it was supposed to be.

These now refer more to the souls that are lodged in the marvelous crystals. This "Crystallization of the soul" is the so-called "Umamusume Soul".

Place the jewel or "Uma Ticket", After a burst of change will gets "Faded Umamusume Soul". 

These dull colored crystals don't work at all. 

Offering these dull crystals directly to the statue of the Goddess will cause the crystals to glow again with the gift of the Three Goddesses.

After transform to "Uma Musume", By default the current motivations and selected skill are displayed in the bottom right corner of the HUD. 

 There is a blue bar on the right side of the HUD representing the current Action Pt, which is not shown by default if Action Pt has been fully restored.

## Carrot Jewels
The so-called Carrot Jewels are jewels that are specially carved in the shape of a carrot. These jewels are favored by the Three Goddesses. 

 Carrot Jewels are mainly offered to the Triple Goddess, but can also be used to synthesize important blocks such as Umamusume Pedestals. It is a wasteful way to offer them directly to the Three Goddesses, and it is now common practice to use them to synthesize "Uma Tickets".

### Crafting: Jewel
**All Free!**

Some villagers also trade with each other using Carrot Jewels, which is the second most useful use of Carrot Jewels.

## Umamusume Pedestal
The Umamusume Pedestal is a pedestal used for offering tributes to the Three Goddesses.

 After the first appearance of Umamusume Soul, the pedestal for the offerings to the three goddesses was refined, culminating in a beautiful pedestal of this design. The main purpose of the pedestal was to pray to the Three Goddesses for the granting of the Umamusume Soul, and so this pedestal was also called, in the mouths of the "trainers," the summoning pedestal - the pedestal for the summoning of the Umamusume Soul! .

Place the jewel or "Uma Ticket", After a burst of change will gets "Faded Umamusume Soul". 

However, if a book is placed on the Umamusume Pedestal, the book instantly changes and becomes part of the summoning pedestal - a levitating book with a blue cover. Instead of getting the Umamusume Soul, such a Pedestal will get a card - a Support Card. The Support Card is a very important item as a "training" item.

The Umamusume Pedestal exists in both gold and silver colorways, with only the gold pedestal yielding the rarest item, identified by its purple name. 

<span style="color:#f00"><b>Please show your devotion by taking down your secondary prop when summoning.</b></span>

## Three Goddesses Statue
The "Three Goddesses" are the original three Umamusume, the gods who govern the Umamusume. They give the Umamusume soul, power, and knowledge, and show the direction of the Umamusume. ......

For trainers, the greatest significance of the Three Goddesses Statue is the activation of the Faded Umamusume Soul. At the same time, "Factor Inheritance" is also the Three Goddesses Statue.

### Crafting: Three Goddess
Did they really come?

## Motivations & Panicking
Although Umamusume Soul appears to be just a crystal, you can feel the inner heart of Umamusume after changing into it. 

Motivation is what you can feel most directly. 

Umamusume Soul's mood will be directly reflected on the user, not only will the mood be high or low along with it, but it will also directly affect how the power is utilized. Therefore, it is very important to keep the Motivation high.

There are five stages of motivations: <span style="color:#EB4573">Peak</span>, <span style="color:#EE7C40">High</span>, <span style="color:#F18E0F">Normal</span>, <span style="color:#1968B3">Low</span>, and <span style="color:#6A4497">Slump</span>, with the states decreasing in the order above. 

 Injury is usually the main cause of lowered motivation, and consuming some odd-tasting foods may also lead to lowered motivation. The fastest and most common way to get back in the motivation is to consume tasty food, such as tasty drinks or desserts.

![umapyoi:textures/book_images/motivations.png](/umapyoi/assets/img/book_images/motivations.png)

If Motivation is already Peak, continuing to lower Motivation may lead to "Panicking". 

 Anxiety prevents a person from regaining Action Pt naturally. You can take the edge off by drinking some milk or using the "Serene" skill. Incidentally, Panicking does not affect other ways of regaining Action Pt, such as drinking Vital.

## Umamusume Ticket
These special tickets are collectively known as Umamusume Tickets, or Uma Tickets for short. 

 Presumably because of the wording printed on these tickets, they are likewise rewarded with an Umamusume Soul or Support Card when offered to the Three Goddesses.

Because they consume relatively fewer jewels and can constrain the outcome of the corresponding summoning, these horse tickets are very popular with trainers. 

 The result of a summoning is determined by a combination of the quality of that ticket and the type of the pedestal. Since you can't get the rarest items with a silver pedestal, you can't use the highest-quality tickets either.

### Crafting: Blank Ticket
While both Jewels and Blank tickets can be used for summoning, summoning with them will only yield items of the most common quality. The separate Umamusume Ticket and Support Card Ticket are different. You cannot mix the two or you will not be able to summon.
