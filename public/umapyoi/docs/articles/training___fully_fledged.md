# Training & Fully Fledged
"What is Training? What is Fully Fledged?" and other related questions are mainly documented here.

## Training Terminal
Although there are still unknown possibilities for Umamuseme Soul, one thing is certain: Soul, which has just regained its light, is not able to show its full power. The process of channeling "Fully Fledged" and maximizing its power is a major issue now. This process is called "training", and the people who train these Umamuseme Souls are called "trainers".

Until Fully Fledged, its inherent power cannot be fully applied to the user. 

 In this respect, the essence of Fully Fledged is to liberate the full power of an Umamuseme Soul's inner being, and the training is to build up the power and prepare for it.

The most popular training equipment is the newly designed Training Terminal, which is the result of several years of research by the entire training staff. The most important feature of this terminal is that six different support cards can be inserted at the same time to carry out the training process, and the whole process is automated. All you need to do is insert the preset support cards, put in the Umamuseme Soul to be trained, and then start the terminal to automate the training process.

Some old-fashioned trainers stick to traditional training methods and you can find them in villages. 

 They will trade with you for some things that you might use during the training process.

### Crafting: Training Terminal
For technical reasons, <span style="color:#f00"><b>Training Terminal cannot be canceled voluntarily once started!</b></span>

If you need to forcibly cancel training, you will need to move the training Umamuseme Soul out of Training Terminal.

## Statuses & Skills
The Umamusume Soul has five statuses, as well as a number of other additional attributes and skills associated with it. 

 The five statuses are: <span style="color:#57C3F9"> Speed</span>, <span style="color:#FE6C55"> Stamina</span>, <span style="color:#FFAE1F"> Strength</span>, <span style="color:#FF8AAF"> Guts</span>, and <span style="color:#23E0A7"> Wisdom</span>. 

 Status is the main indicator of the level of Umamusume's ability, and how to further improve Status is a major issue for trainers.

<span style="color:#57C3F9">Speed</span> controls the speed of movement; <span style="color:#FE6C55">Stamina</span> controls the cap of life and hunger; <span style="color:#FFAE1F">Strength</span> controls the damage dealt in melee; <span style="color:#FF8AAF">Guts</span> brings extra armor value; and <span style="color:#23E0A7">Wisdom</span> affects the learning of skills and the Action Pt cap.

There are times when different Umamusume have different effects at the same Status level. 

 This is because each Umamusume has different bonuses in different attributes related to what they originally specialized in.

In addition to Status, there are some additional attributes. These are Physique, Telent, Memory, and Action Pt. 

<span style="color:#f00"><b>These extra attributes cannot be directly boosted by means other than Factor Inheritance.</b></span>

Physique determines how many times that Soul can be trained, the higher the Physique the more training can be done; 

Telent determines the number of training books that can be read; 

Memory determines the number of skills that can be learned; and 

Action Pt allows Umamusume to use more skills in the same time period.

Skills are another important indicator of Umamusume's statuses. Except for the skills that come with Soul, which we call inherent skills, all other skills need to be learned later. The 

right skill at the right time is the key to turning the tide. That's why skills are sometimes even more important to an Umamusume than statuses.

There are four types of skills: Gaining, Restoring, Hindering and Passive. Enhancement skills provide benefits to yourself or nearby entities; Restoration skills restore status to yourself or nearby entities; and Hindering skills provide negative effects or direct damage to other entities. 

 Normally hindering skills do not negatively affect themselves. 

 Passive skills cannot actively trigger skill effects. On the contrary, passive skills will be activated automatically based on specific situations.

There are three ways to acquire a skill: Factor Inheritance, Training, and Learning Alone. 

 The first two of these require a corresponding Factor or Training program and there is no guarantee that Umamusume will be able to learn the skill, but they do not have the Wisdom restriction. Learning the skill alone requires a Skill Book and Skill Learning Table, and the skill is learned by consuming the Skill Book. This method requires a certain amount of Wisdom as a base, but it is absolutely guaranteed that a skill can be learned.

Skills consume Action Pt. If there is not enough Action Pt, the skill cannot be used. The 

 Action Pt limit is directly related to the Wisdom level, and increasing Wisdom can result in a large Action Pt limit. Similarly, some Support Cards offer training programs that increase the Action Pt limit.

There is a limit to the number of skills an Umamusume can learn. If the number of skills reaches the upper limit, no other skills can be learned. 

<span style="color:#f00"><b>Skills cannot be unlearned, so care needs to be taken with skills, plan wisely.</b></span>

### Crafting: Skill Learning Table
For skill books, look in the loot chest yourself, or ask the trainer nearby.

## Support Card
Support Cards are magical cards that provide power directly to Soul. 

 We have reason to believe that the Support Cards are a record of events that Umamusume has experienced in the past, either in this world, or in worlds we don't know about. In fact, some of the texts extracted from the support cards confirm this.

The support card is mainly to provide power to Soul, today you just need to insert the support card in the training terminal in advance. 

Once the training terminal is activated, the terminal will input the events and experiences recorded on the support cards into Soul, transforming them into Soul's power. 

These cards help trainers to carry out their training, hence the name "support card", i.e. cards that provide training support.

The contents of a support card are roughly divided into two main sections: "Supporters" and "Support Items". 

 Supporter is the character that the Support Card corresponds to, while the Support Items are all the abilities that the Support Card can provide, such as Attribute Enhancements and Skills.

Because of the conflict reactions that can occur, it appears that two different support cards for the same character cannot be used at the same time, much less two identical support cards at the same time. 

 If a Support Card does not have any Supporters on it, it means that the Support Card can be used with all Support Cards except its own.

Different types of support cards exist. In addition to Attribute Cards, which correspond to the five main types of Status - Speed, Stamina, Strength, Guts, and Wisdom - there are also Friend Cards and Team Cards. 

 Of these, only Team Cards will have multiple Supporters.

Attribute cards provide a large number of attributes in addition to the possibility of learning skills; Friend cards do not provide a large number of basic attributes, but do provide special support items. The 

 team cards provide a large number of attributes and special support items, but the presence of multiple supporters makes them extremely vulnerable to conflict.

While the use of support cards is convenient, there are two important issues: conflict and wear and tear. 

 Just as Support Cards can conflict with each other, Umamusume Soul can also conflict with Support Cards. If an Umamusume to be trained conflicts with any of the Supporters of any of the Support Cards in the Training Terminal, the Training Terminal cannot be activated.

The support card cannot be read by the training terminal for a long period of time, so it is subject to wear and tear during actual use. 

 When a Support Card reaches the end of its lifespan, it will break and disappear. 

You can repair a Support Card with any Hoof Crystal, but you cannot repair two Support Cards with the Synthesis Table - it will only result in a single Scrap Card. Scrap cards can only be recycled into a silver Horseshoe Crystal.

Grindstone seems to be able to repair two different support cards into intact support cards without causing a scrap card situation. 

 Because of this, many trainers also borrow villagers' Grindstone to help repair cards.

## Traditional training methods
In the past there was a ritualized form of training, but now all that remains are the written records and experiences left behind by the ancients. 

 These writings have been restored and reformatted into books or scrolls to aid in training, collectively known as training books, which are now very popular in the village.

However, to train with these training books, you need to become Umamusume before reading. As you read, you will learn from the text, thus increasing your ability. 

 Please note that there is only a limited amount of knowledge in the text, so you will not be able to increase your ability after a certain level of reading the training books.
