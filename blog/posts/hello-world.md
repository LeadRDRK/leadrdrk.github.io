# Hello world!
welcome!!! to my blog!!!!1

So. What is this even for, you might ask?

# The need for rambling
As horrible as it might be, Twitter is my main social media *(no it's not called X shut up)*. If you've been following me on Twitter, you'll know that I exclusively post nothing but my own art, and occasionally some programming stuff that's interesting enough to share with people.

In contrast, if you're friends with me and you're somehow part of the group of people that I frequently talk to, you'll know that I'll talk about anything and everything that I'm currently doing. Why the discrepancy?

### My twitter audience
For better or for worse, most people found me on Twitter through my art. And so I thought, great, I have an audience for my art now! But what about the other stuff?

The gist is that I'm scared of scaring people away. Also, posting unrelated content to an audience of people who don't care is like talking to a brick wall. And I have loads of things that I just want to put out for everyone to see, besides just posting an image every so often.

### It doesn't need to be on Twitter...
Twitter is a microblogging platform. It has a limit on how much you can write before you have to pay $8 a month for a stupid blue checkmark. That's fine; Twitter has its own place on the internet, doing its own thing. It doesn't need to let people write long posts (because that's just stupid and goes against the entire purpose of the site)

...okay, enough of that. The point is that what I want to post doesn't fit on there anyways.

# The solution
So, I made this blog, an exclusive place just for me to scream into a different kind of wall!!! The kind of wall that people could stand on the other side to hear what I'm preaching about if they're interested.

I know that fewer and fewer people are interested in self-isolated blogs nowadays and nobody might be reading my posts, but hey, that's okay! That's also one of the purposes of this blog; I want selected people to read my blog on their own volition and I don't need random folks reading my junk. Oh, and it also acts as my own personal archive.

I'll be posting about stuff that I'm interested in, which includes but is not limited to: technology, art, music, random rants, etc.

### How was this blog built?
What you're seeing here was built with Vite + 11ty (which are two really cool projects you should totally check out!). Originally, other parts of the site were written for Vite only and I didn't want to switch to 11ty, so 11ty is actually awkwardly mounting itself on Vite via a plugin instead of the other way around.

So yeah it's a really freaky SSG setup. But it works! *oh and just for bragging rights i wrote all of the layouts on here yeaaaaa 100% original baybee*

# Final words
